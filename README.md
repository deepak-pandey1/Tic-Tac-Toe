<h1>Tic Tac Toe Game</h1>

<p>This project is a simple and interactive Tic Tac Toe Game built using <strong>HTML</strong>, <strong>CSS</strong>, and <strong>JavaScript</strong>. The game allows two players to take turns marking the spaces in a 3x3 grid. The first player to get three of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.</p>

<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Two-Player Mode</strong>: Players take turns to place their marks (X or O) on the grid.</li>
  <li><strong>Winning Logic</strong>: The game detects the winner once three marks are aligned, and it highlights the winning line.</li>
  <li><strong>Draw Condition</strong>: If all the spaces are filled and no player wins, the game ends in a draw.</li>
  <li><strong>Restart Game</strong>: Players can restart the game at any time by clicking the restart button.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Technologies Used</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>HTML</strong>: For structuring the game board and layout.</li>
  <li><strong>CSS</strong>: For styling the board, marks, and other elements.</li>
  <li><strong>JavaScript</strong>: To implement the game logic and interactivity.</li>
